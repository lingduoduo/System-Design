Amazon API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that provides developers with an easy, simple, scalable, flexible, pay-as-you-go service that handles all aspects of building, deploying, and operating robust APIs for application back-end services such as code running on AWS Lambda, applications running on Amazon EC2, or any web application. Amazon API Gateway handles several tasks involved in processing and accepting up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, access control, authorization, monitoring events, and API version management.

AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda enables you to run code without provisioning or managing any servers or infrastructure. You can run any code for any kind of application or back-end service. You simply develop code for your application or back-end service and define the event triggers with the AWS Lambda service. AWS Lambda then takes care of provisioning the resources to run your code, produce the results, and tear down the code. You can also run code in response to event triggers such as Amazon S3 uploads, Amazon DynamoDB updates, Amazon Kinesis streams, Amazon API Gateway requests, and so on. The pricing for using AWS Lambda is simple. You pay only for the compute time when the code is getting executed; there is no charge when the code is not running. AWS Lambda scales automatically. Whenever you upload your code, AWS Lambda take cares of scaling the code automatically. When code is executed, the high availability is also taken care of automatically; in other words, the code is scaled with high availability as well.

Amazon CloudFront provides advanced CDN features such as SSL support, geographic restriction, and private content. It can be easily integrated with other AWS products, thereby providing businesses with an easy way to accelerate content. As of this writing, AWS has 100-plus Amazon CloudFront locations.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) includes the virtual servers, called instances, in the cloud. A customer can choose from a wide variety of instances. Some of them are CPU intensive, some of them are memory intensive, some of them are accelerated computing optimized as in GPU optimized, some of them are storage optimized, some of them are input/output (I/O) instances, and some of them are general-purpose instances. Depending on the use case, the customer can choose from a variety of instance types. For example, if you are running a database workload that needs lots of memory, you can choose a memory-intensive instance, and if you are planning to run machine learning, you can choose an accelerated computing instance.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps in automatically scaling the Amazon EC2 instances up and down as per the policies you define. Combining Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling, you can create a high-availability architecture. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also ensures that you are always running with the desired number of instances. If for some reason an instance goes down, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling quickly spins up a new instance. You can define Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policies for various metrics and health checks. For example, you can set the CPU utilization metric to, say, 70 percent in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to add more servers to handle a load that exceeds that amount. Similarly, if a server is not healthy, you can use the health check metric of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to remove a server. There is no additional charge for using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling integrates with Elastic Load Balancer.

Amazon EC2 Container Service
Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) allows you to run Docker containers on Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS is scalable and is a performance container management service. With Amazon ECS you don‚Äôt have to install, scale, and operate your own cluster management infrastructure. You can launch and manage Docker-enabled applications using application programming interface (API) calls. You can use the built-in scheduler, write your own scheduler, or use a third-party scheduler to meet business- or application-specific requirements. Amazon ECS integrates with other services such as ELB and Amazon EBS. There are no separate charges for Amazon ECS; you pay only for the AWS resources used such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes, and so on.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy for you to run your code on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. Kubernetes is open source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.
